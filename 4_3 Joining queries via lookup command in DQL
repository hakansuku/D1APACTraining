> Very often , there are instances where you need to join data in different queries. 
> In DQL you can use the lookup command. Lookup returns a record from a subquery (the lookup table) producing a match between a field in the source table (sourceField) and a field in the lookup table (lookupField).

We will look at how we can use Davis Predictive AI to predict the percentage of host memory usage from existing timeseries usage data.

## 1) Predictive AI : Visualize future trend in host memory usage

> Benefits for predicting : Increased visibility into future capacity demands, Improved decision making for capacity planning, Reduced costs associated with unplanned capacity increases and Increased customer satisfaction.
